# mpy-lib -- MicroPython libraries

This repository contains a number of python libraries designed to work in Micropython.
Most of the libraries are tested with the Esp32 but a number should work with any port of
Micropython.
If not otherwise mentioned, all libraries use the MIT license (same as Micropython itself),
